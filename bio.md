My name is David Profio. My hobbies include playing basketball, table tennis, and video games. I also enjoy going to see movies, learning more about technology, and playing with my dogs. I have two border collie mixes who enjoy bugging me quite a bit when I try to get some coding done.

I graduated with my first Bachelor's degree in May of 2014. My degree was in Public Health with a concentration in Healthcare Administration. I had originally desired to work as a hospital administrator, but while working at my current company I had the opportunity to work with computers. That is when I realized I wanted to do this as a career. 

Programming Background

I currently work as a junior developer at an insurance company where I complete very basic .NET programming projects. I am enjoying the process of learning C#. My favorite project from work has been utilizing regular expressions to find and fix errors from the reading of invoices. 

I did enjoy learning C++ a great deal during CS 161 and CS 162. My favorite project from these courses was when we were required to program Conway's Game of Life. It was the first truly challenging program that I had to write. I understood the logic, but the process of formatting the output was difficult. 

I originally installed Github during 162 as a method of practicing version control, but I decided I did not want to invest the time to learn it yet. At work we utilize Subversion for version control, and I find this method to be quite easy perhaps a bit easier than git so far.
