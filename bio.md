My name is David Profio. My hobbies include playing basketball, table tennis, and video games. I also enjoy going to see movies, learning more about technology, and playing with my dogs. I have two border collie mixes who enjoy bugging me quite a bit when I try to get some coding done.

Programming Background

I currently work as a junior developer at an insurance company where I complete very basic .NET programming projects. I am enjoying the process of learning C#. My favorite project from work has been utilizing regular expressions to find and fix errors from the reading of invoices.
