My name is David Profio. My hobbies include playing basketball, table tennis, and video games. I also enjoy going to see movies, learning more about technology, and playing with my dogs. I have two border collie mixes who enjoy bugging me quite a bit when I try to get some coding done.

I graduated with my first Bachelor's degree in May of 2014. My degree was in Public Health with a concentration in Healthcare Administration. I had originally desired to work as a hospital administrator, but while working at my current company I had the opportunity to work with computers. That is when I realized I wanted to do this as a career.
